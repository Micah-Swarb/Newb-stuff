=begin
If you define a variable monkey that's equal
to the string "Curious George", and then you have a string that says
"I took #{monkey} to the zoo", Ruby will do something called
string interpolation and replace the #{monkey} bit with the value
of monkeyâ€”that is, it will print "I took Curious George to the zoo"
